# Tate's algorithm

Implementation of Tate's algorithm for elliptic curves in mathlib4:
* Some personal ports of Group/Int/Nat/Ring lemmas
* A definition of extended natural numbers 'Enat.lean'
* An environment for the models and quantities associated to elliptic curves 'Model.lean'
* An extension of commutative rings with a normalized valuation 'ValuedRing.lean'
* An implementation of Tate's algorithm over the integers 'TateInt.lean'
* An implementation of Tate's algorithm over the rings 'TateRing.lean'
* Tests to compare our output with LMFDB's data 'test/Test.lean'
* An implementation of the Kronecker symbol for integers 'Kronecker.lean'
